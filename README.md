# MCA_thermodynamics
Source codes for simulation of flux control coefficients and thermodynamic variables in metabolic networks with representative structures. Codes were tested on MATLAB R2016b.

**Linear**: Metabolic networks with linear (first-order) enzyme kinetics
- **Branch Point_2 Downstream**: Metabolic network with a branch point consisting of two downstream fluxes and one upstream flux.
- **Branch Point_2 Upstream**: Metabolic network with a branch point consisting of two upstream fluxes and one downstream flux.
- **Linear Pathway**: Linear metabolic pathway without branch points.

**Zero-order**: Metabolic networks with zero-order (substrate-saturated) enzyme kinetics
- **Branch Point_2 Downstream**: Metabolic network with a branch point consisting of two downstream fluxes and one upstream flux.
- **Branch Point_2 Upstream**: Metabolic network with a branch point consisting of two upstream fluxes and one downstream flux.

**dscatter.m**: MATLAB codes for generating density scatter plots. This function is used in visualizing the results of simulation.
